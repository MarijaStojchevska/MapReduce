# MapReduce
 We can find a bin and an src folder in both AsymetricFriendships and SymetricFriendships. 
 In the src folder the user can find a Java progam in which the Mapper and Reducer classes are implemented.
 The Mapper class contains one map() function and the Reducer class one reduce() function, respectively.
 With this MapReduce technique we can count the number of friends of each user, but only for asymetric relations when the
 program in AsymetricFriendships 

 With this MapReduce technique we can count either each user's assymetric frendships stored in the Twitter database of assymetric         relations, or each user's symmetric friendships stored in the Friendster databse of symmetric relations.
